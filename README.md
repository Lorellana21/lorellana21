### A bit more about me 

Coming from the _translation and communication world_, then absorved into the _cultural and tourism universe_...                                                                     
Now I´m really "pursuing my dream": becoming a **Frontend Developer** and get my first job in the _IT cosmos_.

For that reason:                    
                                   
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my **Portfolio** to show the projects I´ve developed in **Adalab´s Bootcamp**
- 🌱 I’m reinforcing what I´ve learnt at the Bootcamp and buildind my **personal project** 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with that **job search**
- 💬 Ask me about **JavaScript || React || HTML5 || CSS3 || SASS || Document writing || Agile & SCRUM || Node Js**
- 📫 I would like to collaborate in **Open Source Projects**
- ⚡ I practise **Yin-Yoga** because I´m able to connect my inner self with the essential in life
