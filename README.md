### A bit more about me 

Coming from the _translation and communication world_, then absorved into the _cultural and tourism universe_... 

Now, I´m really "pursuing my dream": to become a **Frontend Developer** and get my first job in the _IT cosmos_.

For that reason:                    
                                   
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my **Portfolio** to show the projects I´ve developed in **Adalab´s Bootcamp**
- 🌱 I’m reinforcing what I´ve learnt at the Bootcamp and buildind my **personal project** 
- 👀 I am not only **looking for a job**, but for my life purpose. 
      My dream is to find a company that shares my values and be part of a **winning team** ✌
      
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with that **job search**
- 📫 I would like to collaborate in **Open Source Projects**
- ⚡ I practise **Yin-Yoga** because I´m able to connect my inner self with the essential in life
- 💬 Ask me about:
